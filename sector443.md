## Introduction

Technologies are advancing day by day, new things get invented every day in computer science. Every new technology brings new kind of vulnerabilities in them. It is two-sided sword where bad guys out there waiting to exploit/misuse technologies around us and we all know the answer is cybersecurity. But when it comes to cybersecurity there has been a problem of the skill gap in the industry. Especially when Computer Science or IT college graduate joins the workforce has no idea about security mechanics available to them in any given tech. There is lot's of training material out there on cybersecurity but not everyone can afford them and we are talking about students who are already crushed under various kind of debts. Some of these training materials don't even provide practical exposure to students. In simple words, if don't know how to break security as real cybercriminals do, you won't be able to prevent them. Learning cybersecurity is like learning computer science with a destructive viewpoint. Software developer builds stuff with computer science knowledge us cybersecurity guys apply that same knowledge to put technologies at test. 

So, Sector443 (sector - place or area, 443 port number for HTTPS) is a community place to learn cybersecurity open to everyone for collaborative research work. We will be using the same tech that other software developers use to develop new tech but here the creation of cybersecurity technologies will be primary objective by providing a platform to students which keeps them very close to industry. Our aim to make cybersecurity education open to everyone free of cost.

## Objectives

* All of sector443 members from students to working professional will put thier best efforts to develop educational content and matrial in any form for cybersecurity.
* Open chapters around the globe in various educational insitution estalishments and universities
* We love other infosec communities who are bringing security professionals together, so our members will be contributing to them by giving talks/presentations to share knowledge and research experience gained in this community. This will help other recruiters (who attends security conferences and checks the previous contributions) out there to identify new talent within us.
* Conduct free of cost workshops and hands on training sessions in productive environment.
* Recruit new people into community on basis of skill and not by dicriminting anyone on bases of gender, sexual orientation, race, color, ethinicity and religion.
* Make students industry ready before they graduate.


## Expected outcomes
* Shortage of skill gap in cybersecurity industry will be full filled.
* Big tech companies don't have to worry about training the individuals for cybersecurity and will have easy access to the pool of skilled and talented individuals who can conduct security research work efficiently.
* Collaborative research efforts will be a step towards making technologies of tomorrow secure.

*That's all for right now the above statements represents vision behind sector443 in long run as of now at the time of writing this document we are currently situated in SRM Institute of Science of Technologies, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. For more information head over to links below*
